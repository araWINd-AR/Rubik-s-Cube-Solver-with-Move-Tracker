# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver-with-Move-Tracker
A reinforcement learning (RL) agent can solve the Rubik's Cube using Q-learning, learning optimal moves without relying on pre-defined algorithms. The agent refines its decisions using Q-values, balancing exploration of new moves with exploitation of known good moves. Transparent move documentation allows detailed analysis of the learning process.
